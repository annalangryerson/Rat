		<h2> Ratatoullie The Summary</h2>

It was the eighth film produced by Pixar, and was written and directed by Brad Bird, who took over from Jan Pinkava in 2005, and produced by Brad Lewis, from an original idea from Bird, Pinkava and Jim Capobianco. The title refers to the French dish ratatouille, which is served at the end of the film and also references the animal type of the main character, a rat. The plot follows a rat named Remy, who dreams of becoming a chef and tries to achieve his goal by forming an alliance with a Parisian restaurant's garbage boy.

		<h2> Ratatoullie The Reviews</h2>

		<img id="userleft1" src= "usericon.png"/ width="100">
		
		<p id="revlft1">This is a film about a rat who becomes a chef in Paris. But it's so much more than that. It's about what a great artist can be, where a great artist can come from, it's about food and how to savour it. 
		</p>
		
		<img id="userleft2" src= "usericon.png"/ width="100">
		<p>Ratatouille is delightfully unique and funny at the same time, with animation that will have salivating over it, hungry for more. And it's ending is probably one of Pixar's most powerful overall. Simply fantastic. 
		</p>
		
		<img id="userleft3" src= "usericon.png"/ width="100">
		<p>Pixar's latest installment is a recipe of success. Ratatouille is bold and classy with the flare of European culture. Patton Oswalt's adventurous critter spices a flamboyant film with an interesting plot and dynamic delivery. 4/5 
		</p>
